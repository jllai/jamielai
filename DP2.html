<h1 class="dp2">Netflix Showtime</h1>

<div class="problem-statement dp2-setup">

  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

  <p>Netflix is a streaming service that takes shows and movies and lets subscribers watch them anytime, anywhere. When a show or movie is released onto Netflix, subscribers are able to stream and watch them all at once - a phenomenon called “bingeing”. However, the way this product is structured makes Netflix a fairly solitary product; there is no real way to connect with other users and increase social interaction, because the shows and movies are meant to be streamed on your own time, rather than with groups of people (like network TV).
  <br><br>
  <b>There is no easy way for a Netflix user to extensively engage with other users while streaming a show or movie.</b></p>
</div>

<div class="dp2-setup">
  <h3>Target Market</h3>
  <p>Netflix Showtime can take advantage of the blooming streaming industry and the inherent gap streaming creates. People enjoy seeing that other people are saying when a show airs (see: Twitter and the Game of Thrones premiere), but streaming does not allow this tradition. Netflix Showtime intends to patch this gap in streaming by creating a space where people can gather together to live chat about the show/movie they watch.</p>
  <p>The market for this product consists primarily of Netflix users who 1) are part of a movie/show’s fanbase like Pulp Fiction or Stranger Things, and looking for a communal space to watch shows with other fans, and 2) Friends or significant others in a long distance relationship looking to reconnect through something low-key but highly engaging.</p>
</div>

<div class="dp2-setup">
  <h3>Personas</h3>

  <div class="personas">
    <h4>Primary Persona</h4>
    <p>Name: Jackson Jones <br> Age: 27 <br> Location: Toledo, OH <br> Favorite Netflix shows: Stranger Things, Black Mirror, The Office, Parks and Rec, Daredevil <br> Bio: Jackson is a sociology/psych PhD student who enjoys spending his free time online playing games and bingeing his favorite shows. He’s an avid user of social media platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, and Twitter, and primarily uses these platforms to talk to fans of the shows he enjoys watching. However, now that more and more of his favorite shows are entering the Netflix domain, he feels a pressure to finish an entire season before interacting with anyone online.</p>
    <p>Goals/Motivation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To become closer to the fanbase and talk to more people that are also fans of the shows he enjoys</li>
      <li>To feel the communal joy of watching a show with thousands of other people at the same time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Frustrations/Pain Points</p>
    <ul>
      <li>He hates the pressure of rushing through a season or movie before engaging with fans online</li>
      <li>He misses the way network TV allowed him to live tweet and react live with other fans of the show</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Secondary Persona</h4>
    <p>Name: Kamala Harrison <br> Age: 18 <br> Location: Ithaca, NY <br> Favorite Netflix shows: GLOW, Queer Eye, Orange is the New Black, You <br> Bio: Kamala loves watching Netflix with her friend group back home in Michigan. Whenever her friend group gets together, they always find a fun show or movie to watch together. Since moving away for college, Kamala’s been struggling to find a foothold in her new life, and wishes for some form of stability. She misses her friends, and wants a way to connect with them while they’re living their different lives.</p>
    <p>Goals/Motivation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To maintain a connection with her childhood friends as they split into different life paths</li>

    </ul>

      <li>It’s difficult to do stuff with her friends when they’re so far away</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tertiary Persona</h4>
    <p>Name: Yin Guo <br> Age: 23 <br> Location: Singapore <br> Favorite Netflix shows: Breaking Bad, Mindhunter, You, Master of None <br> Bio: Yin was an international student studying at Columbia, but she recently moved back to Singapore shortly after graduation to work at a company there. She loves her new job and is excited for the opportunities it will bring her, but she also misses her American partner, who’s finishing up their final year in school. The long distance, coupled by the half-day time difference, makes it extremely difficult to talk to them, let alone find things to do with them. She can feel the relationship starting to strain because of this, and she wants to find a way to fix it.</p>
    <p>Goals/Motivation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>She loves her partner, and wants to maintain a strong relationship with them</li>
      <li>Find activities that they can do together despite the distance and time difference</li>
      <li>Find time to also talk to her partner as well</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Frustrations/Pain Points</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The time difference and distance makes it nearly impossible to properly talk and do things together</li>
      <li>She just wants to be able to talk and see her partner and maybe even do small activities together, but she can’t</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class="dp2-setup">
    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p>I did an assortment of competitive analyses to determine the best layout for this Chrome extension. Right now, the only competitor really is Netflix Party, which only does private chats for friends and syncs of the play/pause buttons, but little else.</p>
    <img src="img/netflix-party.png">
    <p>Another product I looked at was Twitch. Twitch mirrors a lot of what my product will have; a live chat, an active stream, and, the ability to hop into the middle of a stream.</p>
    <img src="img/twitch-chat.png">

    <p>After looking at other products for inspiration, I knew what I needed: a chatbox that anyone, anonymous or not, can enter, preset showtimes that will start on the half hour, and the ability to start and join and private screening with friends and/or significant others.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dp2-setup">
    <h2><a href="https://invis.io/BHRK19BS3ZT">Final Prototype</a></h4>
  </div>

  <div class="dp2-setup">
    <p>I wanted the product to be as personable and friendly as possible. This means making the chat seem familiar, and making the aesthetics of the extension look similar to Netflix's aesthetics.</p>
    <p>The first thing I did was make the showtime options. I wanted them to start every half an hour, so people have time to set settled, and yet not have to wait so long that they get bored and decide to leave.</p>
    <img src="img/find showtime.png">
    <p>Then, I let everyone choose their own handle/username. This makes it a lot easier to identify certain people, which makes the entire chat feel more real and more like the users are talking to actual people.</p>
    <img src="img/input username.png">
    <p>From here, the chatroom is pretty intuitive to use; you can hide the chat whenever you want, you can pin certain users to see their funny remarks, and other users can ping you using the "@" symbol.</p>

    <p>As for the private showtimes feature, I followed Netflix Party's example of providing a link for other friends to click on in order to join. While not the most efficient way, it is the easiest for this first iteration.</p>
    <img src="img/inviting.png">
    <p>After everyone is onboarded, the private screening can start and everyone has the option of turning on their audio and video for better communication.</p>
    <img src="img/video with friends.png">
  </div>

  <div class="dp2-setup">
    <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
    <p>There were a few usabilities issues that I cleaned up after a few usability tests on friend. The main ones were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making the volume toggle on a person's video more explicit. This was fixed by adding a very small volume icon to the red slider</li>
      <li>Changing the "pin user" so that while the user shows up in the grey box about your chatline, it also shows up in the chat still to provide the necessary context to the user's post</li>
      <li>Giving a slightly different visual for when people mention you in the chat by placing the notification outside of the chat to make it more visible and to not get it mixed up with the pinned user's posts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="dp2-setup">
    <h3>Future Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I want to replace the linking aspect of the private chat with a sleeker and more efficient feature.</li>
      <li>The chatbox can be a lot more fleshed out with extra features like reactions, gifs, stickers. Something similar to Slack and Facebook Messenger</li>
      <li>A third major feature I was thinking about was something in the lines of Twitch where famous/popular streamers can start a private chat that all their audience can join. The streamer would be the only one able to turn on video/audio, and everyone else can talk in the chat while they watch the streamer react to the movie/show.</li>
    </ul>
